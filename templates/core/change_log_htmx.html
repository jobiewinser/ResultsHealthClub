            <h5>V0.5 - 06 December 2022</h5>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Remade the system for assigning auto send templates to a campaign, now can assign up to <b>10 templates per campaign</b>. Added a seperate popup window for adding new templates. Removing the template choices from the campaign configuration page has freed up some space.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Added new concept of a campaign type to allow the system to cater to wider spanning gyms (i.e the system can similtaneously be used for group class leads and a PT training course for example).
                </li>
                <li>
                    Added <b>Google Sheets style "Who's Working" section</b> with profile pictures at the top of the leads page showing who is currently on the lead board! Very cool!
                </li>
                <li>
                    Made an <b>Edit Lead Section</b>. Currently only on the leads page, soon to be on the booking page too.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Made the leads columns equal lengths again.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Made card dragging a little smoother. Still more to be done though.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Added a character limit to each section of the whatsapp template with explanations on why.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Added frontend validation on the whatsapp template name to prevent users accidentally submitting an invalid name.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Made submitting a new whatsapp template a little more responsive (it tells you what it's doing in the background).
                </li>
                <li>
                    Added double clicking leads (or tapping) to make it touch friendly. <b>Mobile now kind of supported</b>.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Restyled the analytics page a bit more.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Booking table now sorted by booking date... Duh!
                </li>
                <li>
                    Added Date booking made in booking history.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Added a <b>New Login Page</b>. Image is placeholder.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Login username/email is not case sensitive any more.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The value of a lead is now determined upon creation, based on the campaign value at that moment in time. This can be edited in the new edit lead popup.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Added search to various select boxes (select2 library).
                </li>
                <li>

                    Completely reworked the leads board. New system has a nice ghost card card-white showing where the card card-white will end up and shifts existing cards in column around. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    Completely restyled the whole site. Looks a lot for relaxed and less formal. Sadly had to remove Eleanor's lovely background for now. Will likely put it on the whatsapp chat window below.

                <li>
